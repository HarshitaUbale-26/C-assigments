1. What is the purpose of the main() function in a C++ program?
ðŸ”¹ It is the starting point of every C++ program.
ðŸ”¹ The computer runs the code inside main() first.

 2. Explain the significance of the return type of the main() function.
ðŸ”¹ The return type is usually int.
ðŸ”¹ return 0; means the program ran successfully.

 3. What are the two valid signatures of the main() function in C++?
cpp
Copy
Edit
int main()                        // used when no input is needed
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) // used for command-line arguments
 4. What is function prototyping and why is it necessary in C++?
ðŸ”¹ A function prototype tells the compiler about a function before it's used.
ðŸ”¹ It helps the compiler understand the return type and parameters.

 5. How do you declare a function prototype for a function that returns an integer and takes two integers?
cpp
Copy
Edit
int add(int, int);
 6. What happens if a function is used before it is prototyped?
ðŸ”¹ The compiler gives an error because it doesn't know the function details.

 7. What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function?
Declaration: Only tells the name and parameters (no code).

Definition: Has the actual code of the function.

Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int add(int, int);           // declaration
int add(int a, int b) {      // definition
    return a + b;
}
 8. How do you call a simple function that takes no parameters and returns void?
cpp
Copy
Edit
void greet() {
    cout << "Hello!";
}

int main() {
    greet(); // calling the function
}
 9. Explain the concept of "scope" in the context of functions.
ðŸ”¹ Scope means where a variable or function is visible/usable.
ðŸ”¹ A variable inside a function canâ€™t be used outside it.

 10. What is call by reference in C++?
ðŸ”¹ It means passing the actual variable, not a copy.
ðŸ”¹ The function can change the original value.

 11. How does call by reference differ from call by value?
Call by Value	Call by Reference
Sends a copy	Sends the original
No change	Can change value

 12. Example: Swap two integers using call by reference
cpp
Copy
Edit
void swap(int &a, int &b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    swap(x, y); // x becomes 10, y becomes 5
}
 13. What is an inline function in C++?
ðŸ”¹ A small function where code is inserted directly where it is called.
ðŸ”¹ Saves time by avoiding function call overhead.

 14. How do inline functions improve performance?
ðŸ”¹ The function code is copied directly into the main program.
ðŸ”¹ It runs faster for small functions.

 15. Syntax for declaring an inline function
cpp
Copy
Edit
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
